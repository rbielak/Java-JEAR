JEAR

Ear Training program in Java.

I wrote this program in order to learn a bit about Java Swing programming. At this point
the program is functioning, but only has three lessons.

I was planning to invent some kind of XML based file format for defining lessons, but 
never got around to it.

You can use the build.xml script to compile everything. An exacutable "jar" file is also included.

	ant jar 
	
will create a jar file. You will need the Ant build tool.

To run the "jar" file just type:

	java -jar jear

You will need the Java SDK. I tested with 1.4 and 1.5.

Let me know if you run into any problems.
